# BuyingCatalogueService - Service architecture for the NHS Digital Buying Catalogue
.Net Core application, based on a service architecture.

## IMPORTANT NOTES!
**You can use either the latest version of Visual Studio or .NET CLI for Windows, Mac and Linux**.

### Architecture overview
This application uses <b>.NET core</b> to provide an API capable of running on Linux or Windows.

> For the frontend web application see <a>https://github.com/nhs-digital-gp-it-futures/public-browse</a>.
>
> For the data model see <a>https://github.com/nhs-digital-gp-it-futures/DataModel</a>

### Overview of the application code
This repo consists of one service to provide multiple resource endpoints for the NHS Digitial Buying Catalogue application using <b>.NET Core</b> and <b>Docker</a>.

The application is broken down into the following project libraries:

- API - Defines and exposes the available Buying Catalogue resources to the frontend
- Application - Provides the different use cases and functionality for the Buying Catalogue
- Domain - Defines the entities and business logic for the application
- Persistence Layer - Provides access and storage for the Buying Catalogue data

## Setting up your development environment for the Buying Catalogue

### Requirements
- .NET Core Version 3.0
- Docker
- Data Model repository

> Before you begin please install <b>.NET Core 3.0</b> & <b>Docker</b> on your machine.
> Also download and store the Buying Catalogue Data Model repository along side this repository.


# Running the API


## On a Windows Box
*All scripts are meant to be run in PowerShell from within this directory*

To run the application in a container in development environment, run the following script:

```
 & '.\Launch Environment.ps1'
```

You can now access the API in your browser at 'http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html'

To stop the application running in a container and to delete the associated images, run the command: 

```
& '.\Tear Down Environment.ps1'
```

### Extra flags
- Attached mode - directs docker-compose output to your CLI
    ```
    & '.\Launch Environment.ps1' -a
    ```
- Clean mode - removes all images, resources and networks
    ```
    & '.\Tear Down Environment.ps1' -c
    ```
- Quiet mode - doesn't do a `docker ps -a ` after finishing
    ```
    & '.\Launch Environment.ps1' -q
    ```
    or 
    ```
    & '.\Tear Down Environment.ps1' -q
    ```

## On a Linux/Mac Box
*All scripts are meant to be run in bash from within this directory*

To run the application in a container in development environment, run the following script:
```
bash launch_environment.sh
```
You can now access the API in your browser at 'http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html'

To stop the application running in a container and to delete the associated images:
```
bash tear_down_environment.sh
```
### Extra flags
- Attached mode - directs docker-compose output to your CLI
    ```
    bash launch_environment.sh -a
    ```
- Clean mode - removes all images, resources and networks
    ```
    bash tear_down_environment.sh -c
    ```
- Quiet mode - doesn't do a `docker ps -a ` after finishing
    ```
    bash launch_environment.sh -q
    ```
    or 
    ```
    bash tear_down_environment.sh -q
    ```
</p>

## Local Debugging

Firstly, run 'Create Local Db' script

### On a Windows box
```
& '.\Create Local Db.ps1'
```

### On Linux/Mac box
```
bash create_local_db.sh
```

Secondly, copy and paste the connection string into your [User Secrets file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=windows#how-the-secret-manager-tool-works). Your file should have this format:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "BuyingCatalogue": "Data Source=127.0.0.1,$port;Initial Catalog=$db_name;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;User Id=$username;Password=$password"
  }
}
```
Lastly, run the API - either through your favourite IDE or using your favourite shell - from root of the directory run
```
dotnet run --project ./src/NHSD.BuyingCatalogue.API
```

### Flags
The scripts have default values for the port that your database listens on, username and password, but they can be specified by passing them when calling the script like so:

### Windows:
```
& '.\Create Local Db.ps1' 1420 MyTestUser MyT3stP@ssword!
```

### Bash:
```
bash create_local_db.sh 1420 MyTestUser MyT3stP@ssword!
```

This would run the database on port 1420, create an user with the id 'MyTestUser' and set its password to 'MyT3stP@ssword!'


# Integration Tests

Integration Tests and Persistence Tests run against Docker containers of service, a [mock of the document api](tests/NHSD.BuyingCatalogue.Documents.API.WireMock/README.md), and the database.
These tests rely on a docker image 'integration_db', this image must be created before running any tests. [How to is listed below.](#integration_db_setup_id).

<br/>

## On a Windows Box

### Before running tests
```
'.\Launch Environment.ps1' i
```
### Running tests
```
& '.\Run Component Tests.ps1'
```
or
Test Explorer in your favourite IDE

### After running tests
```
& '.\Tear Down Environment.ps1' i
```

### Extra flags
- Attached mode - directs docker-compose output to your CLI
    ```
    & '.\Launch Environment.ps1' i -a
    ```
- Quiet mode - doesn't do a `docker ps -a ` after finishing
    ```
    & '.\Launch Environment.ps1' i -q
    ```
    or 
    ```
    & '.\Tear Down Environment.ps1' i -q
    ```

## On a Linux/Mac Box

### Before running tests
```
bash launch_environment.sh i
```
### Running tests
```
bash run_component_tests.sh
```
or
Test Explorer in your favourite IDE

### After running tests
```
bash tear_down_environment.sh i
```
### Extra flags
- Attached mode - directs docker-compose output to your CLI
    ```
    bash launch_environment.sh i -a
    ```
- Quiet mode - doesn't do a `docker ps -a ` after finishing
    ```
    bash launch_environment.sh i -q
    ```
    or 
    ```
    bash tear_down_environment.sh i -q
    ```

## <a name="integration_db_setup_id"></a> Integration db setup
In order to speed up the API Integration test execution, a docker image which contains all the data needed has been build.
This docker image needs to be built locally before running the API Integration tests. It only needs to be built once, and then updated every time the DataModel changes.
To build / update the image run `setup-integration-db` script either in PowerShell or Bash

### Running the Script
| CLI | Command |
|---------------|--------------------|
|`bash` | `bash setup-integration-db.sh` |
| `PowerShell` | `.\setup-integration-db.ps1` |

## Troubleshooting
- `./integration-entrypoint.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found` during the image build
 run `dos2unix` on the integration-entrypoint.sh script

 - Error: "Start Buying Catalogue API failed, could not get a successful health status from 'http://localhost:8080/health/live' after trying for '01:00'"
Have you remembered to run `Launch Environment.ps1 i` :) ?
