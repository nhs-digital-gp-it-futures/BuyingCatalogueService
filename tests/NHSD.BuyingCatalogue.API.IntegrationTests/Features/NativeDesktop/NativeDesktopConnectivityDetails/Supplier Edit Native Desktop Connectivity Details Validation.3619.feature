Scenario: 1. Connectivity Details is set to null
    Given SolutionDetail exist
        | Solution | SummaryDescription             | FullDescription   | ClientApplication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
        | Sln1     | An full online medicine system | Online medicine 1 | { "ClientApplicationTypes": [], "BrowsersSupported": [], "MobileResponsive": null, "Plugins": null, "MinimumConnectionSpeed": null, "MinimumDesktopResolution": null, "HardwareRequirements": null, "NativeMobileHardwareRequirements": null, "NativeDesktopHardwareRequirements": null, "AdditionalInformation": null, "MobileFirstDesign": null, "NativeMobileFirstDesign": null, "MobileOperatingSystems": null, "MobileConnectionDetails": null, "MobileMemoryAndStorage": null, "MobileThirdParty": null, "NativeMobileAdditionalInformation": null, "NativeDesktopOperatingSystemsDescription": null, "NativeDesktopMinimumConnectionSpeed": "3Mbps", "NativeDesktopThirdParty": null, "NativeDesktopMemoryAndStorage": null } |
    When a PUT request is made to update the native-desktop-connection-details section for solution Sln1
        | NativeDesktopMinimumConnectionSpeed |
        | NULL                                |
    Then a response status of 400 is returned
    And the minimum-connection-speed field value is the validation failure required
    And SolutionDetail exist
