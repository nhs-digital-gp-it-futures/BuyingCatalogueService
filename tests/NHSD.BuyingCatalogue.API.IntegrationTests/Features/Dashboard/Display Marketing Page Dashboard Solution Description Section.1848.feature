Scenario Outline: 3. Solution description section is mandatory and is reported complete if there is text in the summary
    When a GET request is made for solution dashboard <Solution>
    Then a successful response is returned
    And the solution solution-description section status is <Status>
    And the solution solution-description section requirement is Mandatory
Examples:
    | Solution | Status     |
    | Sln1     | INCOMPLETE |
    | Sln2     | INCOMPLETE |
    | Sln3     | COMPLETE   |
