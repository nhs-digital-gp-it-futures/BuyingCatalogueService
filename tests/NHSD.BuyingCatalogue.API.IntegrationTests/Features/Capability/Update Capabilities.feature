Feature: Update Capabilities
    As a Public User
    I want to update the Capabilities for a Solution
    So that I can modify who the Solution Capabilities are

Background:
    Given Capabilities exist
        | CapabilityName      | CapabilityRef | IsFoundation |
        | Resource Management | C1            | false        |
        | Prescribing         | C2            | true         |
        | Workflow            | C3            | true         |
    And Suppliers exist
        | Id    | SupplierName |
        | Sup 1 | Supplier 1   |
    And Solutions exist
        | SolutionId | SolutionName   | SupplierId |
        | Sln1       | MedicOnline    | Sup 1      |
        | Sln2       | TakeTheRedPill | Sup 1      |
    And Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | Solution             | Capability          |
        | TakeTheRedPill       | Resource Management |

Scenario: A Capability is added to a solution which has no capabilities
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln1
        | CapabilityRefs |
        | C2             |
    Then a successful response is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln2       | C1             |
        | Sln1       | C2             |

@3678
Scenario: A Capability is added to a solution which has has a capability
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln2
        | CapabilityRefs |
        | C2             |
    Then a successful response is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln2       | C2             |

@3678
Scenario: Multiple Capabilies are added to a solution which has has a capability
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln2
        | CapabilityRefs |
        | C1, C2, C3     |
    Then a successful response is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln2       | C1, C2, C3     |

@3678
Scenario: Capabilies are removed for a solution which has has a capability
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln2
        | CapabilityRefs |
    Then a successful response is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln2       |                |

@3678
Scenario: A Capability is added for a solution which has has multiple capabilies
    And Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | Solution    | Capability          |
        | MedicOnline | Resource Management |
        | MedicOnline | Prescribing         |
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln1
        | CapabilityRefs |
        | C3             |
    Then a successful response is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln1       | C3             |

@3678
Scenario: Two of the same capability references are added, only one is linked.
    When a PUT request is made to update the capabilities section for solution Sln1
        | CapabilityRefs |
        | C1, C1         |
    Then a response status of 204 is returned
    Then Solutions are linked to Capabilities
        | SolutionId | CapabilityRefs |
        | Sln1       | C1             |
        | Sln2       | C1             |
